# MultiRoblox
A script meant for AFK farming on Roblox games using multiple instances
=====================================================

### Overview
MultiRoblox is a mini project developed by @WhatAVibe (Discord) for automating Roblox game farming using multiple instances. It's designed to work alongside Roblox Account Manager or other tools that manage multiple Roblox windows under the same name.

### Requirements
To run the script, you'll need the following files:
* `Multi.exe` (written in AutoHotkey)
* `log.exe` (written in Python)

You can remove the `log.exe` file if you don't want to display the log window. The script will still function without it.

### Features
* Cycle between open Roblox windows with the name "Roblox" or "Roblox Game Client" by pressing F1.
* Cycle between scripts in the `cfg.ahk` file using the hotkey F1.
* Repeat scripts in the `extra.ahk` file by pressing F3 or using the Mouse3/Forward button.
* Reload the script entirely by pressing F5.
* Close the script and log.exe by pressing F2.

### Notes
* Your antivirus may flag the files as potential viruses due to their behavior, but this is known as a false positive.
* The log file is larger than the actual script due to compiling extra libraries, allowing users to run the script without installing additional software.

### Support
